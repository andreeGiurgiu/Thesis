,,,,,Brouwersgracht,,,"This canal is sometimes cited as the ""most beautiful street of Amsterdam"".

The warehouses here used to store goods such as coffee, spices and leather, but now serve a residential purpose. Traditional warehouses with the row of spout gables can be found at Brouwersgracht 196–188, and at 204, 206, 208 and 210. Also check out the wide-open red shutters at ''Groene Valk'' (192) and ''Grouwe Valk'' (194).

At the time, the project was highly controversial as the new station would effectively cut off the city from the IJ waterfront.

Many school children learn that because of the swampy soil, it was built on no less than 13,569 wooden poles. In 1795, the French Empire of Napoleon Bonaparte invaded the Netherlands, and his brother Louis Napoleon became the first King of Holland in 1806. He acquired the city hall in that year and turned it into a royal palace. It was restored to the original owners when Prince William VI returned to the Netherlands in 1812, but when he was crowned as King William I, he decided that Amsterdam should be the official capital and acquired the city hall once again as a royal palace. This is still a delicate subject among the locals, some of who would like to see the palace returned to Amsterdam. It was completely renovated in 2009.

This happened at a time when the Dutch provinces were fighting for independence against Spain. As to avoid being related to the enemy, these Jewish refugees originally from Spain began to refer to themselves as ""Portuguese Jews"". In the early 16th century, the three Jewish communities that existed at the time merged to form the Portuguese Jewish Community of Amsterdam, which still exists today.
