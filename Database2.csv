It was built in 1651 as the city hall of Amsterdam, in a period known as the Dutch Golden Age. Many school children learn that because of the swampy soil, it was built on no less than 13,569 wooden poles. In 1795, the French Empire of Napoleon Bonaparte invaded the Netherlands, and his brother Louis Napoleon became the first King of Holland in 1806. He acquired the city hall in that year and turned it into a royal palace. It was restored to the original owners when Prince William VI returned to the Netherlands in 1812, but when he was crowned as King William I, he decided that Amsterdam should be the official capital and acquired the city hall once again as a royal palace. This is still a delicate subject among the locals, some of who would like to see the palace returned to Amsterdam. It was completely renovated in 2009. It is mainly used for diplomatic receptions and to welcome visiting heads of state, not as a royal residence.",52.373199,,", , , , X, X, , ",,"Amsterdam, paleis op de Dam 2007-03-26 11.32 .JPG",,,“Russian Treasures” from Kaufman Collection,,1012XZ,,Dam,,,,,,,gift,,,4.891276,,,,Tu-Su 12:00-17:00,,,,http://www.paleisamsterdam.nl/,,Koninklijk Paleis,,,,,,see,+31 20 620-4060,,,€7.50,,,,,,,“Russian Treasures” from Kaufman Collection,,gift,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This happened at a time when the Dutch provinces were fighting for independence against Spain. As to avoid being related to the enemy, these Jewish refugees originally from Spain began to refer to themselves as ""Portuguese Jews"". In the early 16th century, the three Jewish communities that existed at the time merged to form the Portuguese Jewish Community of Amsterdam, which still exists today. They were joined by Ashkenazi Jews that arrived from Central and Eastern Europe in the 17th century, together forming the largest Jewish community in Amsterdam and the Netherlands.
